# bkk-commute
Find the most optimal solution to commute in Bangkok with A-start search. The vehicles used in this project are BTS, MRT, APL, and taxi. The criteria are price and duration. The user could assign his/her own preference weights for price and duration. This project could be improved further by adding more data, using better heuristic function, adding more criteria, etc.

This project is a part of Artificial Intelligence course for MSc in computer science at Chulalongkorn University, Thailand. There are five other students contributed to this project.
